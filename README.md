We're trained to put styles in Javascript. We've got these awesome and rather complex toolchains to have tools like [Rebass](jxnblk/rebass). But, sometimes, you just want to re-use styles.

Awesome stylesheets are already out there for browsers, its just awkward to make use of them when you're writing react. Cramming everything into that `className` string feels wrong.

`classier-react` solves the problem by simply translating from props to CSS classes. Its not generating code and its not pushing the browser to its limits.

```jsx
const Button = props => (
  <Box rounded bg="blue" py={2} px={4} {...props} is="button" />
)
```

Think of it like weaponized `classnames`.

## Install

```
npm install classier-react
```

## Getting started

You'll have to have configured your build toolchain with a style loader and have added some styles to use the tool. This usually isn't very much setup.

See the [TailwindCSS Recipe](docs/recipes/tailwindcss.md) for an example configuration thats one of the more complicated.

## Usage

_Note: This example uses utility classes from [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)._

You'll define your presentational components:

```jsx
import { Box, Comp } from 'classier-react'

const Card = props => (
  <Box rounded shadow="lg" maxW="sm" overflow="hidden" {...props} />
)

const CardHeroImage = ({ src, ...rest }) => (
  <Comp w="full" border={['black', 'solid']} {...rest}>
    <img src={src} />
  </Comp>
)

const CardTitle = ({ size = 5, ...rest }) => (
  <Box is={'h' + size} text="xl" font="bold" mb={2} {...rest} />
)

const CardBody = props => <Box px={6} py={4} {...props} />
```

And then consume them as usual:

```jsx
<Card maxW="md">
  <CardHeroImage src={image} border={false} />
  <CardTitle>So Classy</CardTitle>
  <CardBody>Lorem ipsum...</CardBody>
</Card>
```

## Translation to style names

Under the hood, `classier-react` assumes any unknown props are declared as modifiers in your stylesheet. Props are translated to these declarations according to simple rules:

- Any props with an explicit `false` value are omitted

- prop values are appended to their names

  - each value of an array will generate its own prop class

- camelCase words become kebab-cased

- Sentence-casing is preserved but not added

## Passing down styles

`<Comp />` only injects the props it merges, it can't make sure they are rendered. If you're wrapping or writing a component, it's a good idea to pass any props you don't use onward to what is rendered.

Most components are already written this way.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ option, ...rest }) => <div {...rest} />
```

## CSS Modules

`classier-react` supports using CSS Modules through dynamic object keys:

```jsx
import styles from './styles.css'

...

<Box {...{
  [styles.fontSize]: 'md'
}} {...rest} />
```

## Avoiding mixing domains

You can also use `cx` and pass around the resulting string yourself:

```js
import { cx } from 'classier-react'

...

const containerClassName = cx(props.styled)
```

## API

```js
import { Box, Text, Comp, cx, configure } from 'classier-react'
```

---

### `<Box />`

Renders a tag with its unknown props translated to CSS classes.

#### props

- **is**: the tag to render as (_default: 'div'_)

---

### `<Text />`

Renders a span with all its props translated to CSS classes.

---

### `<Comp />`

A _HOC_ for injecting or "composing" style props. Merges its `style`, `className`, and the rest of its props as classes into the props of a child component.

---

### `cx(props, ...extraClasses)`

Transform the passed props into a className string. Called by Box and Comp.

---

### `configure(opts)`

Lets you change the global behavior of `cx`

#### opts

- **kebabCase** - Transform names and values from camelCase. Reverses `style-loader`. (_default: true_)

- **keepSentence** - When kebabing, lower-case everything but the first word (_default: true_)

- **join.words** - the string to insert between the words in a camelCase identifier (_default: '-'_)

- **join.value** - the string to insert to separate a value (_default: '-'_)
